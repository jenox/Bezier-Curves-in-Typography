> “In what ways have you considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others?” ― Apple

During my third semester at university, I held a tutorial for the introductory course on programming. Seeing what students just getting started in computer science struggled with and being able to help them out gave me a whole new perspective on things. Since then I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Theoretical Computer Science. I also give private lessons and help out friends majoring in different subjects with their computer science parts.

The things I learned at last year's WWDC helped me answer some longstanding questions of mine on StackOverflow. In my spare time, I often browse the site to see if there's anything that I've been dealing with recently where I might be able to help out.

It's been my goal to start my own Swift blog for quite some time now, but I didn't find the time for it just yet. There are so many topics where I find existing articles and tutorials very disappointing and would like to share my approach to those problems. Things I want to write about include custom views, layout in code, and baseline anchors in Auto Layout.

I am also a big fan of Swift Playgrounds. It's great for quickly trying out new ideas without the overhead of making an entire app, especially if it isn't something UI-related. The iPad app also allows me to teach friends who do not own a Mac but might want to get started with Swift nonetheless.
